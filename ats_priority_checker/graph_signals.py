"""Supporting priority signal read directly from the Spectrum plot's pixels
(top-left panel of the embedded chart screenshot), on top of the same OCR
text already used for style detection in extract.py.

Per the domain guidance behind this module: this is not a standalone
verdict. Report writers sometimes under-state urgency for equipment that's
been high-priority before, so this exists to catch that - but it's
supporting evidence to combine with the text-based prediction, not a
replacement for it.

Status / history:
- v1 (Fund Amp text field): read the printed "Fund Amp: X" line next to the
  Spectrum plot. Retired - Fund Amp is the amplitude at whichever harmonic
  order the analyst happened to list first, not the tallest peak in the
  plot, and the two can disagree a lot (e.g. a report with Fund Amp: 0.064
  whose actual tallest Spectrum peak is ~1.85 on a 0-2 scale). Do not bring
  Fund Amp extraction back.
- v2 (this version): reads the Spectrum plot's PIXELS directly - finds the
  tallest genuine data peak, reads it off the y-axis's own printed tick
  labels (OCR'd, calibrated with RANSAC so a misread digit or two doesn't
  wreck the whole scale), and floors it to the nearest labeled gridline at
  or below the peak. Validated by hand against 3 real reports spanning two
  different y-axis label spacings (0.5 and 0.05) and three different kinds
  of on-chart marker (a fixed-height magenta "harmonic flag" bar with a
  callout line down to the real peak; a cyan zoom-selection box with no
  relationship to data height at all; small red circle/number annotations
  sitting directly on top of genuine peaks). See _find_peak_pixel for how
  markers are told apart from real data. This is a best-effort pixel
  heuristic, not pixel-perfect - the plateau-width and run-length
  thresholds below are tuned against those 3 reports, not the full ~115
  labeled set, so if you have Spectrum peak readings that look visibly
  wrong once you run this against your real data, that's the first place
  to retune (see the constants just below the imports).
- Waterfall/Trend charts: intentionally not read. The old Trend pixel
  heuristic here topped out around a 75% ceiling across five different
  techniques even for a narrower "is it escalating at all" question, well
  short of what precise point-reading would need - don't re-add
  Waterfall/Trend pixel analysis without re-reading that discussion.
- Cross-report escalation (comparing a reading against the same
  equipment's own prior dated test): tried (dataset.py's
  add_escalation_signals) and removed. This report set has multiple
  distinct measurement points per equipment_id (see
  detect_measurement_point below), often in different units, and not
  every equipment_id has a same-point history to compare against at all -
  after several rounds of trying to patch the grouping logic (by
  equipment_id alone, then equipment_id + measurement_point, relaxing the
  same-unit requirement, etc. - see the conversation this is from), the
  conclusion was that there isn't a reliably consistent per-machine
  timeline to compare against in this data, not just a bug to fix. There
  is currently NO cross-report/historical signal in this project - each
  report is judged only on its own text and its own chart reading. Don't
  re-add a cross-report escalation signal without a concrete plan for
  what makes two readings comparable (same equipment AND same
  measurement point AND same unit, at minimum) and how thin that leaves
  the usable data.
- Future idea (not implemented): compare the FREQUENCIES of each report's
  peaks across dated reports for the same equipment, to catch a resonance
  shifting frequency even when its amplitude doesn't change much. Would
  need each peak's x-axis (frequency) calibration too, not just y-axis -
  same OCR+RANSAC approach as below would likely extend to it. Would
  inherit the same "what's actually comparable across reports" problem
  escalation ran into, so worth reading that entry first.

    the tick labels are right-aligned against (used later to locate the
    plot frame's left border, which sits just past it).

    Two things this works around, found by testing against real reports:
    - Tesseract regularly drops the decimal point on these small chart
      fonts ("0.5" -> "05"). Rather than trying to guess where a missing
      point goes, this only keeps tokens that already look unambiguous
      ("\\d+\\.\\d+" or a bare "\\d+") and lets RANSAC calibration (next
      step) work from whatever legible subset that leaves.
    - The axis title ("gE - Peak"), a value baked into the title text
      above the plot, and other stray OCR fragments can each produce a
      spurious numeric-looking token. Real tick labels are right-aligned
      against the axis line, so this clusters candidates by their right
      edge and keeps only the largest cluster - reliably keeps the real
      ticks and drops the rest, even when a couple of them have very low
      OCR confidence (confidence alone was tried and wasn't reliable
      enough to use as the primary filter here). It's used as a tie-
      breaker between same-size clusters, though - confirmed on a real
      report where a rotated fault-frequency callout (a "Fund Amp: ..."
      readout and a bearing-defect label, both printed in the plot's top-
      left corner, right where the y-axis's own top tick labels are)
      happened to right-align within the clustering tolerance of each
      other AND tie the real tick cluster's size, so whichever cluster's
      tokens Tesseract happened to emit first (scan order, not anything
      meaningful) silently won - here, the annotation cluster, leaving
      nothing usable to calibrate against. Every real tick label seen
      across every report tested OCRs at 88+ confidence; every spurious
      token from rotated/decorative annotation text seen OCRs at 0 - not
      close enough to call reliable on its own (hence not the primary
      filter), but a clean way to prefer the real cluster on an exact
      count tie rather than leaving it to scan order.
    - A single tick label can be missing from one psm pass entirely, or
      have its digits garbled, while a DIFFERENT pass reads it cleanly -
      confirmed on two real reports where Tesseract's default assumed-
      layout mode (--psm 6, "one uniform block of text") merged/dropped a
      label sitting close above or below another one (a "1" tick directly
      under a "1.05" one; a "0.5" tick swallowed by a nearby callout's
      dotted leader line), while --psm 6 misread a THIRD (a lone "0.2")
      that --psm 6's own neighbor-relative digit model got dragged off by
      an adjacent "92"-shaped fragment above it. --psm 11 ("sparse text,
      no assumed layout") reads each of those correctly where 6 didn't -
      but flips the failure the other way on a label 6 already had right
      (misread "1.5" as "15", decimal dropped), so it's not a strict
      upgrade to switch to on its own. Both passes run and their
      candidates POOL into one list rather than one replacing the other -
      safe to do because a wrong token from either pass (a stray "15", a
      misread "99") almost never lands on the real calibration line, so
      _ransac_calibration's existing outlier rejection (built to survive
      exactly this kind of single bad token) discards it same as always;
      meanwhile a label only one pass caught cleanly now has a chance to
      make it into the kept set at all, instead of leaving a gap
      _floor_to_axis_label has nothing to floor down to.

    Toolbar/title-bar chrome above the plot can be just as dark as the
    frame border, so top/bottom aren't found by "the darkest row" - they're
    found by anchoring to the y-axis calibration instead: bottom is the
    strong horizontal line closest to the calibration's own value=0 row,
    and top is the strong line closest to where the highest OCR'd tick
    should be. That estimate is enough even when OCR missed the very top
    label entirely (seen for real: a "2" tick rendered flush against a
    small triangle max-value marker, which tesseract failed to read even
    after upscaling) - the frame border pixel search recovers the exact
    row anyway.

    Two different "dark" tests are used here, deliberately not the same
    one, for the two different things being searched for:

    - Finding the left/right border COLUMNS requires near-neutral color
      (small max-min channel spread), not just each channel under 140 -
      see FRAME_BORDER_MAX_CHANNEL_SPREAD for why a plain per-channel test
      lets a genuine colored peak's own trace column outscore the border's
      real (black) column and get picked as the left edge instead of it,
      when that peak sits at a low enough frequency to run almost the
      full plot height right next to the y-axis (confirmed on a real
      report). Column detection needs this tightening because nothing
      else dilutes a single peak's own column - it's either clearly the
      border or clearly a peak.
    - Finding the top/bottom border ROWS deliberately keeps the original
      looser test (any channel-under-140 pixel, colored or not). The
      bottom border row in particular is a case where TIGHTENING backfires:
      confirmed on the same real report, that row is a horizontal line
      that nearly every near-zero-amplitude frequency bin's own vertical
      trace also touches (their baseline sits right on it), so requiring
      neutral color there throws out most of the row's own dark pixels as
      "trace-colored" and can make a same-colored coincidence elsewhere
      look stronger than the real border - the loose test correctly
      treats "was dark for some reason" as enough evidence for a
      full-width horizontal line, where the column search cannot afford
      to.

    """Find the (row, col) of the Spectrum plot's tallest genuine data
    peak, in panel-pixel coordinates - the core of "read the actual graph,
    not markings that get in the way".

    On these reports, on-chart markers/annotations come in two shapes that
    both need excluding, and one shape that's fine to leave in:

    1. Wide flat-topped blocks - a colored bar flagging a fault frequency,
       a zoom-selection box, etc. Many adjacent columns share (about) the
       same topmost ink row. A real spectral peak is one frequency wide,
       at most a couple of pixels - so any run of more than
       MAX_PLATEAU_WIDTH_PX columns at the same height is a block, not
       data - EXCEPT a column that's already blue-dominant there
       (_is_blue_ish, same test point 2 uses) is excluded from that count
       and left alone entirely, not just exempted from the cap. Two real
       reports needed this: a rotated harmonic-flag label box sitting
       directly on top of a severe peak (the box's bottom edge touches the
       peak's tip with no row gap, so without the exemption the peak's own
       column reads as just more of the same plateau), and, separately, a
       severe peak with no marker involved at all, whose own several
       antialiased-width columns near its near-vertical rise were on their
       own enough columns to exceed MAX_PLATEAU_WIDTH_PX. A plain "applies
       regardless of color" version of this check (tried first) reads
       either of those as a wide block and erases the peak along with it -
       exactly backwards, same failure shape as the height cap in point 2
       ignoring blue would have, and for the same reason: the taller and
       more severe a real peak is, the more columns of its own width look
       "flat" by this test. A column inside a detected block does NOT just
       get dropped, though - it gets peeled: the block's own run in that
       column is skipped, and whatever ink comes after it (below it) in
       that same column is looked at next, same as for a tall thin mark
       below. This matters because a marker can sit directly ON TOP of
       genuine data in the same column, not just next to it - confirmed on
       a real report, a bar box + its callout line hid a real peak that
       was over a full labeled gridline taller than the peak this function
       used to report before that column was ever looked at below the box.
       See MAX_PEEL_PASSES for how many stacked layers one column can have
       peeled before giving up on it.
    2. Tall thin marks that AREN'T richly-saturated blue - rotated
       marker-label text, a UI cursor/order-marker line (e.g. red, with a
       small square handle sitting right at/above the frame's top edge -
       confirmed against real reports; the small circle sitting just below
       that handle is part of the same marker, not a peak annotation) -
       only 1-2 columns wide, so the width check above doesn't catch them.
       What does: their own column runs solid ink for most of the plot's
       height (verified on a real report: 318-474px on a ~430px-tall
       plot). Antialiasing and letter-shaped gaps inside a marker can chop
       that long run into several short ones a few pixels apart -
       GAP_MERGE_PX bridges gaps that small before measuring, so the
       marker doesn't masquerade as a short (real-looking) run. This
       height cap is deliberately NOT applied to a run that's (mostly)
       blue-dominant in hue - see _is_blue_ish - a genuine sharp, narrow-
       bandwidth resonance can legitimately run near-vertically for most
       of the plot's height in a single column (confirmed on two real
       reports, one with a richly-saturated trace and one with a lighter,
       washed-out one - the taller and more severe the true peak, the more
       likely a color-blind height cap is to wrongly exclude it, which is
       exactly backwards), and the real peak is reliably THICKER (more ink
       per row) than a hairline cursor/order-marker line even where they
       sit close together in x. _is_blue_ish uses a fixed threshold tuned
       from real reports' own baseline trace color rather than a per-
       report "what's the dominant color here" estimate - tried that
       first (twice), and both approaches picked a report's decorative
       marker-label text over its actual trace on a report where the two
       happen to be rendered in a similar hue - see that function's
       docstring for the full story before changing this.
    3. Small annotations directly on a real peak (a circle, a number, a
       triangle) - a few pixels, sitting right at or just above the
       genuine tip. These pass every filter above and are left in on
       purpose: they shift the reading by at most a few pixels, and that's
       an acceptable trade for not needing a marker color palette that
       would have to be hand-maintained per report style.

    Ahead of all three checks above, one column-local, color-blind rule
    runs first: a column whose ink runs unbroken from the very top row of
    the plot area to the very bottom row (within FULL_HEIGHT_TOL_PX of
    literally touching both edges) is thrown out outright, before
    anything else looks at it. This is the UI cursor/order-marker line
    from point 2 above, caught by its shape alone this time instead of by
    failing the blue-ish test - confirmed on a real report to run exactly
    row 0 to the last row, edge to edge, which no genuine peak does (even
    a severe one - see point 2's own genuine-tall-peak examples, neither
    reaches literally either edge). Doesn't change any known report's
    reading (the height-cap-plus-color-check in point 2 already excludes
    it) - it's a second, color-independent way to reach the same answer,
    which matters because point 2's blue-ish check is a per-pixel color
    judgment call and this one isn't.

    Returns (row, col) of the winning pixel, or (None, None) if the plot
    area has no ink at all.

    Confirmed on two real reports: the axis had real, evenly-spaced
    gridlines at a 0.5 step (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5...), but the "1" label sat
    close enough beneath the auto-scaled top-of-axis label ("1.05") that
    Tesseract couldn't read it at any --psm mode or upscale factor tried

    The fix doesn't try to OCR harder - it reasons from what's already

    Every multiple of that step lying strictly between the lowest and

    exist on the chart whether or not its printed label survived OCR, so

    peak_amplitude used to be the floored reading, on the reasoning that
    trading precision for staying anchored to a number actually printed on
    the chart was worth it. Changed after a direct real-report comparison
    (report_153: floored to 1.0, interpolated to 1.21, a person reading
    the same chart by eye also independently said "about 1.2") - flooring
    can only ever revise a reading DOWN, never up, so across many reports
    it's a systematic downward bias on severity, not neutral rounding.
    It also turned out to be quietly inconsistent with how this project's
    own priority thresholds are fit: velocity_priority_hint and
    acceleration_enveloping_priority_hint are refit against hand-eyeballed
    chart readings (see their docstrings) - a person reading "about 1.2"
    off a chart was never flooring to the nearest printed gridline either,
    so scoring the automated reading against thresholds fit to that kind
    of number, while itself floored, was comparing two different things.
    _floor_to_axis_label / peak_amplitude_floored are kept, not deleted -
    still useful for manually cross-checking a specific reading against
    the chart's own printed numbers - just no longer what feeds
    spectrum_priority_hint or gets used as priority thresholds are fit.

    Never raises - any failure (OCR found <2 usable tick labels, frame
    border not found, empty plot area, ...) comes back as
    peak_amplitude=None with `error` explaining why, so one bad chart image
    doesn't take down a whole build_dataset() run. Callers should treat
    peak_amplitude=None the same as "no signal available", same as the old
    Fund Amp path did below its own noise floor.
