"""Supporting priority signal read directly from the Spectrum plot's pixels
(top-left panel of the embedded chart screenshot), on top of the same OCR
text already used for style detection in extract.py.

Per the domain guidance behind this module: this is not a standalone
verdict. Report writers sometimes under-state urgency for equipment that's
been high-priority before, so this exists to catch that - but it's
supporting evidence to combine with the text-based prediction, not a
replacement for it.

Status / history:
- v1 (Fund Amp text field): read the printed "Fund Amp: X" line next to the
  Spectrum plot. Retired - Fund Amp is the amplitude at whichever harmonic
  order the analyst happened to list first, not the tallest peak in the
  plot, and the two can disagree a lot (e.g. a report with Fund Amp: 0.064
  whose actual tallest Spectrum peak is ~1.85 on a 0-2 scale). Do not bring
  Fund Amp extraction back.
- v2 (this version): reads the Spectrum plot's PIXELS directly - finds the
  tallest genuine data peak, reads it off the y-axis's own printed tick
  labels (OCR'd, calibrated with RANSAC so a misread digit or two doesn't
  wreck the whole scale), and floors it to the nearest labeled gridline at
  or below the peak. Validated by hand against 3 real reports spanning two
  different y-axis label spacings (0.5 and 0.05) and three different kinds
  of on-chart marker (a fixed-height magenta "harmonic flag" bar with a
  callout line down to the real peak; a cyan zoom-selection box with no
  relationship to data height at all; small red circle/number annotations
  sitting directly on top of genuine peaks). See _find_peak_pixel for how
  markers are told apart from real data. This is a best-effort pixel
  heuristic, not pixel-perfect - the plateau-width and run-length
  thresholds below are tuned against those 3 reports, not the full ~115
  labeled set, so if you have Spectrum peak readings that look visibly
  wrong once you run this against your real data, that's the first place
  to retune (see the constants just below the imports).
- Waterfall/Trend charts: intentionally not read. The old Trend pixel
  heuristic here topped out around a 75% ceiling across five different
  techniques even for a narrower "is it escalating at all" question, well
  short of what precise point-reading would need - don't re-add
  Waterfall/Trend pixel analysis without re-reading that discussion.
- Cross-report escalation (comparing a reading against the same
  equipment's own prior dated test): tried (dataset.py's
  add_escalation_signals) and removed. This report set has multiple
  distinct measurement points per equipment_id (see
  detect_measurement_point below), often in different units, and not
  every equipment_id has a same-point history to compare against at all -
  after several rounds of trying to patch the grouping logic (by
  equipment_id alone, then equipment_id + measurement_point, relaxing the
  same-unit requirement, etc. - see the conversation this is from), the
  conclusion was that there isn't a reliably consistent per-machine
  timeline to compare against in this data, not just a bug to fix. There
  is currently NO cross-report/historical signal in this project - each
  report is judged only on its own text and its own chart reading. Don't
  re-add a cross-report escalation signal without a concrete plan for
  what makes two readings comparable (same equipment AND same
  measurement point AND same unit, at minimum) and how thin that leaves
  the usable data.
- Future idea (not implemented): compare the FREQUENCIES of each report's
  peaks across dated reports for the same equipment, to catch a resonance
  shifting frequency even when its amplitude doesn't change much. Would
  need each peak's x-axis (frequency) calibration too, not just y-axis -
  same OCR+RANSAC approach as below would likely extend to it. Would
  inherit the same "what's actually comparable across reports" problem
  escalation ran into, so worth reading that entry first.

      spurious numeric-looking token. Real tick labels are right-aligned

    1. Wide flat-topped blocks - a colored bar flagging a fault frequency,
       a zoom-selection box, etc. Many adjacent columns share (about) the

       data. Applies regardless of color - a genuine trace essentially
       never forms a flat multi-column plateau (real spectral noise is
       jagged), so this is safe to apply universally. A column inside a
       detected block does NOT just get dropped, though - it gets peeled:
       the block's own run in that column is skipped, and whatever ink
       comes after it (below it) in that same column is looked at next,
       same as for a tall thin mark below. This matters because a marker
       can sit directly ON TOP of genuine data in the same column, not
       just next to it - confirmed on a real report, a bar box + its
       callout line hid a real peak that was over a full labeled gridline
       taller than the peak this function used to report before that
       column was ever looked at below the box. See MAX_PEEL_PASSES for
       how many stacked layers one column can have peeled before giving up
       on it.
    2. Tall thin marks that AREN'T richly-saturated blue - rotated
       marker-label text, a UI cursor/order-marker line (e.g. red, with a
       small square handle sitting right at/above the frame's top edge -
       confirmed against real reports; the small circle sitting just below
       that handle is part of the same marker, not a peak annotation) -
       only 1-2 columns wide, so the width check above doesn't catch them.
       What does: their own column runs solid ink for most of the plot's
       height (verified on a real report: 318-474px on a ~430px-tall
       plot). Antialiasing and letter-shaped gaps inside a marker can chop
       that long run into several short ones a few pixels apart -
       GAP_MERGE_PX bridges gaps that small before measuring, so the
       marker doesn't masquerade as a short (real-looking) run. This
       height cap is deliberately NOT applied to a run that's (mostly)
       blue-dominant in hue - see _is_blue_ish - a genuine sharp, narrow-
       bandwidth resonance can legitimately run near-vertically for most
       of the plot's height in a single column (confirmed on two real
       reports, one with a richly-saturated trace and one with a lighter,
       washed-out one - the taller and more severe the true peak, the more
       likely a color-blind height cap is to wrongly exclude it, which is
       exactly backwards), and the real peak is reliably THICKER (more ink
       per row) than a hairline cursor/order-marker line even where they
       sit close together in x. _is_blue_ish uses a fixed threshold tuned
       from real reports' own baseline trace color rather than a per-
       report "what's the dominant color here" estimate - tried that
       first (twice), and both approaches picked a report's decorative
       marker-label text over its actual trace on a report where the two
       happen to be rendered in a similar hue - see that function's
       docstring for the full story before changing this.
    3. Small annotations directly on a real peak (a circle, a number, a
       triangle) - a few pixels, sitting right at or just above the
       genuine tip. These pass every filter above and are left in on
       purpose: they shift the reading by at most a few pixels, and that's
       an acceptable trade for not needing a marker color palette that
       would have to be hand-maintained per report style.

    Ahead of all three checks above, one column-local, color-blind rule
    runs first: a column whose ink runs unbroken from the very top row of
    the plot area to the very bottom row (within FULL_HEIGHT_TOL_PX of
    literally touching both edges) is thrown out outright, before
    anything else looks at it. This is the UI cursor/order-marker line
    from point 2 above, caught by its shape alone this time instead of by
    failing the blue-ish test - confirmed on a real report to run exactly
    row 0 to the last row, edge to edge, which no genuine peak does (even
    a severe one - see point 2's own genuine-tall-peak examples, neither
    reaches literally either edge). Doesn't change any known report's
    reading (the height-cap-plus-color-check in point 2 already excludes
    it) - it's a second, color-independent way to reach the same answer,
    which matters because point 2's blue-ish check is a per-pixel color
    judgment call and this one isn't.

    Returns (row, col) of the winning pixel, or (None, None) if the plot
    area has no ink at all.
